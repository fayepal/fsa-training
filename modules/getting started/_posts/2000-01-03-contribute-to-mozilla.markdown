# Contribute to the codebase

All of Mozilla's products are open source, meaning you can contribute code or even create your own version! All of Mozilla's projects are on [Github](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Github) for you to see. A lot of Mozillians contribute to these projects and as an FSA, you can too!

## Mozilla Firefox

Firefox, being the best browser on the Internet, is the most popular Mozilla product. It is available on desktop (OSX, Linux, PC) and mobile (Android, iOS).

The Firefox for Desktop has three versions you can choose from namely:

  The stable version of Firefox for those who just want to use it, hassle-free.
-Firefox Beta
  For those who are a little adventurous and want to try new things that are still being tested yet.
-Firefox Developer Edition
  For those who want to try the newest features being tested and are totally comfortable working on an unstable environment. Designed to feature tools that can help those who build the Web.
